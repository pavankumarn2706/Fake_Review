Perfect product!,"Really good and well balanced phone. Don't focus on negative reviews, this is one of the best phones for working professionals or college students. Best for daily use, dropped it accidentally twice inside the home from 3-4 feet height and luckily no scratches or dents, i am using the cover provided by the company and the phone did well.  Charging speed and battery support is good. No heating issues. Good camera, you need to switch to ultra res option to use the main camera..",Ravi shukla

Brilliant,"This phone is screaming value for money! Powered by Snapdragon 8 gen 1, it cuts no corners whatsoever in terms of performance. Day to day performance will give you no reason to complain. The 144hz screen is an absolute treat to use. Colors are well balanced and with the powerful processor the high refresh rate causes 0 stutters. It also comes with DC dimming (flicker prevention as Moto calls it) - handy for users who are sensitive to OLED PWM flicker. The speakers are loud and amazingly clear....",Saurav Sen

Terrific,A beautiful stock Android phone. Only if they can improve the front camera for selfies and video calling.

Classy product,You can't imagine the clarity with which the camera would take images even under low lighting conditions.

You can take 2K 4K and 8k videos with this mobile..,Flipkart Customer
Very Good,"Product was delivered in excellent condition at the time as promised. Product is very good with a very good camera. Some cons though are the absence of apps such as notes, compass and a good file manager. Older motor file managers are not compatible with this phone and one is forced go get it from play store and many of these from play store are having ads making them unattractive. Cache deletion requires multiple steps which clearly should be taken care of.",R Manjunath

Just okay,"First of all, as soon as I took this phone, it started hanging after two days.  Then even after updating, it did not work properly, then installed Kaspersky Antivirus, then the situation is fine.  The camera of this mobile cannot compete with the camera of iphone 12. Pixels are also not good in this mobile.  The battery also doesn't last the whole day.  You can't even play heavy games in this.  Gets very hot.  It is priced just because of the cpu 8 Gen 1..",Rajender  Verma
Very Good,Motorola phones offer really good end user experience. Clean UI without any bloatwares and junk apps pre-installed. Day to day performance is very fast and no lag noticed as of now.

Fabulous!,"I had been using a OnePlus 7Pro & wondered what phone to update to next! This was definitely the right choice! Can't be happier with the value for money I have got! 💯👌 a 10/10 experience!A cherry on the icing: the stock ANDROID 12 Experience which I immediately noticed! Next thing is the amazing 10 Bit OLED Screen! With not 90,120 but 144 Hz!! Refresh rate I have installed around 156 apps on my moto! And it works like butter! It packs an 8gen Snapdragon processor! With 8gb ram!! And 128g....",Gabriel Misquitta
Excellent,Motorola is doing the right thingsBut sar value is on the higher side comparing with Mi phonesWill update the review after one week usage.,Vijayaraghavan  R
Waste of money!,Camera is worst ..some heating issues and the response of the executive came to supervise the product after complain was pathetic ...,Anupam  Awasthi
Really Nice,All great . Just the phone heats quickly .After a week's usage it's is quite great . Been a pre one plus user so this phone does not feel premium but definitely has better UI and features .Good to go . Just feel it's a bit over priced ..,Puneet Kumar

Just wow!,very good.,Akash Gupta
Great VFM flagship from Moto. A worthy upgrade from Moto G5P,"After 5 years using Moto G5 plus, this purchase is a major shift in user experience. Larger screen,  HDR display, Stereo speaker and Compass are some of the features I mainly focused on. After 2 days of usage, phone is really excellent except few departments.  There are so many things I liked here. So, I don't want to list what I liked in Edge 30 Pro. Just highlight few points I felt as cons (for me at least)..1. Location of fingerprint scanner and Volume buttons. Bit hard to reach.2. Even....",Selvakumar Ramasamy

Value-for-money,"I have used this phone for 6 months. Pros : Fast processor  and good display. Cons: The size of the phone is not handy, camera quality is not as promised. Overall for this price we can look for a better option.",Balaji Customer
Fair,Needed a usb to audio jack cord with it. It was not provided. Rest everything is good..,Flipkart Customer
Classy product,You can't imagine the clarity with which the camera would take images even under low lighting conditions. The clarity of videos and photos you get is much better than what you actually see with your eye in low lighting conditions.Processor is very very fast. You can take 2K 4K and 8k videos with this mobile..,Flipkart Customer
Decent product,"MOTOROLA Edge 30 Pro is just a good mobile.here are my ratings:Sound : 5 star (Dolby Atmos is very good)Display : 5 start (AMOLED and FHD display and resolution is very good)Camera : 5 start (triple camera 50 MPs good enough and wide angle is covering good)we have 4k resolution recording... but there is external memory slot to store the recorded partMemory : 3 start only. (we have 128 GB internal memory, if you are using high resolution video recording it is not at all enough to store. ....",Ravikumar Veeramalla
Worth every penny,"Motorola Edge 30 Pro is placed at a very reasonable price,  It has the most recent and powerful Snapdragon processor, plenty of memory, fast screen refresh rates, and Motorola bets on cameras. The cameras aren't the best, but it does have the best Android performance, fast charging, and a fantastic design and is the best in class,.",Rohit  Bhandary
Hated it!,Facing Mobile hang problem. Also most of the time apps suddenly get stopped..,Flipkart Customer
Fabulous!,Best phone in high end range.,MOHAMMED SAILANAWALA
Very Good,"Product was delivered in excellent condition at the time as promised. Product is very good with a very good camera. Some cons though are the absence of apps such as notes, compass and a good file manager. Older motor file managers are not compatible with this phone and one is forced go get it from play store and many of these from play store are having ads making them unattractive. Cache deletion requires multiple steps which clearly should be taken care of.",R Manjunath
Slightly disappointed,Don't buy the phone if you are looking for decent camera. The out from camera app is really poor.Other factors are pretty decent.,Akshay K V

Pretty good,"Overall the phone is very good, nice haptic, call & network quality and pixel kind of feel. The only thing is battery backup is not that great, it's ok. Missing in-display fingerprint.I hope Motorola at least provides software updates to this premium device, else it's not the kind of money spent gonna be worth..",Mandar Naik
Fair,"This phone has got heating issues. Also when you are on call the battery drains very fast. Battery is also average, lasts hardly a day. Even when you are are recording a video the phone gets heated up. No updates have been recd till one month of purchase. Needs optimisation in battery and heating. Camera is also super average. Not up to the mark as per price of the phone..",Prakhar Dixit
Worthless,Please don't purchase this mobile and waste your hard earned money.,Sai Krishna
